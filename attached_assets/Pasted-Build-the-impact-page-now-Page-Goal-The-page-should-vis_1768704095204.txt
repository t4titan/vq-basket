Build the impact page now.

🎯 Page Goal

The page should visually and clearly communicate the foundation’s measurable impact using statistics, storytelling, and strong calls to action. It must inspire sponsors and partners to support the foundation’s mission to reach more girls, communities, and states.

🧱 Page Structure
1. Hero Section

Headline: “Creating Lasting Impact Through Basketball & Empowerment”

Subheadline:
Empowering young girls across Nigeria with skills, confidence, and opportunities—on and off the court.

2. Impact Statistics Section (Primary Focus)

Create a grid of animated stat cards (count-up animation):

Be large, bold, and visually prominent

Support dynamic values that can be updated easily later
