Redesign the Brand Ambassador page with the following structure and behavior.

Section 1: Page Header

At the top of the page, add a prominent header:

Header text:
“Meet Our Brand Ambassadors”

The header should be visually distinct, centered or left-aligned based on the site’s design system, and serve as the introduction to the ambassador section.

Section 2: Ambassador Intro + CTA (Before List)

Directly below the header, add an introductory section with the following text:

“Welcome to the VQBF Brand Ambassador page, where we partner with girls at all levels who have a strong pulse for community and servant leadership.

Our ambassadors represent more than basketball — they embody purpose, impact, and a commitment to uplifting others.

If you believe in using your voice, influence, and passion to make a difference, we’d love to hear from you.”

CTA instruction text (placed immediately before the button):

“Think this is you? Click below to apply and become the next VQBF Brand Ambassador.”

CTA Button:

Label: Apply to Become a Brand Ambassador

Uses the site’s primary button style

Clicking the button opens a modal, not a new page

Add subtle entry animations consistent with the rest of the homepage.

Section 3: Ambassador List (Infinite Scroll)

Below the intro section, display the list of brand ambassadors.

List behavior:

Implement infinite scrolling

Load ambassadors in paginated batches as the user scrolls

Use a lightweight loading indicator while fetching more data

Prevent layout shifts during loading

Layout:

Responsive grid layout (mobile → stacked, desktop → multi-column)

Smooth hover and entry transitions

Ambassador Card Requirements

Each ambassador card should display information structured exactly like the reference image:

Ambassador image (primary visual focus)

Name

Short bio / profile description

Basketball background & achievements

Current team or affiliation

Social media handle(s) with platform icons (where available)

Cards should be clean, readable, and visually balanced between image and text.

Section 4: Ambassador Registration Modal

When the CTA button is clicked, open a modal form for ambassador registration.

Modal behavior:

Centered modal with backdrop

Scrollable content if form exceeds viewport height

Closeable via close button or outside click

Form fields to collect:

Personal Information

Full name

Email address

Phone number

Location (City / Country)

Basketball / Ambassador Information

Current team or affiliation

Short bio / background

Why they want to be a VQBF Brand Ambassador

Social Media Accounts (collect 4–5 total):

Instagram

TikTok

Facebook

Snapchat

Twitter (X)

Social media fields should be optional but clearly labeled.

Form UX:

Clear field labels

Validation for required fields

Submit button with loading state

Success feedback after submission

General UX & Performance Guidelines

Ensure full responsiveness across devices

Maintain accessibility (labels, focus states, readable contrast)

Animations should be subtle and not re-trigger excessively

Infinite scroll should be performant and smooth

The final page should guide users from introduction → inspiration → community → action in a clear and engaging flow.
