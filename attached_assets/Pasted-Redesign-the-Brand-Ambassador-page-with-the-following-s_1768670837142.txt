Redesign the Brand Ambassador page with the following structure and behavior.

Section 1: Page Header

At the top of the page, add a prominent header:

Header text:
“Meet Our Brand Ambassadors”

The header should be visually distinct and serve as the introduction to the ambassador section.

Section 2: Ambassador Intro + CTA (Before List)

Directly below the header, add an introductory section with the following text:

“Welcome to the VQBF Brand Ambassador page, where we partner with girls at all levels who have a strong pulse for community and servant leadership.

Our ambassadors represent more than basketball — they embody purpose, impact, and a commitment to uplifting others.

If you believe in using your voice, influence, and passion to make a difference, we’d love to hear from you.”

CTA instruction text (placed immediately before the button):

“Think this is you? Click below to apply and become the next VQBF Brand Ambassador.”

CTA Button:

Label: Apply to Become a Brand Ambassador

Uses the site’s primary button style

Navigates to a dedicated application page (not a modal)

Add subtle entry animations consistent with the site’s design system.

Section 3: Ambassador List (Paginated)

Below the intro section, display the list of brand ambassadors.

Pagination approach (recommended over infinite scrolling):

Use server-side or API-based pagination

Display a fixed number of ambassadors per page (e.g., 9–12)

Provide Next / Previous buttons or numbered page controls

Maintain scroll position when navigating between pages

Pagination is preferred to improve:

Performance

Accessibility

SEO

User control over navigation

Ambassador Card Requirements

Each ambassador card should include:

Ambassador image

Full name

Short bio or profile summary

Basketball background or achievements

Current team or affiliation

Social media handle(s) with platform icons (where available)

Cards should be displayed in a responsive grid:

Mobile: single column

Tablet: two columns

Desktop: three or more columns

Include subtle hover effects and consistent spacing.
