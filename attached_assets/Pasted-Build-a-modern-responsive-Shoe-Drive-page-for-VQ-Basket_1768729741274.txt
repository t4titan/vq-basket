Build a modern, responsive Shoe Drive page for VQ Basketball Foundation, a nonprofit organization empowering young girls through basketball, education, and community programs.

🎯 Page Goal

The purpose of this page is to clearly explain why shoe donations matter, how proper footwear can change the lives of girls who cannot afford shoes, and how individuals, organizations, and partners can donate shoes or provide financial support.

The page should emotionally connect with visitors while making it easy for them to take action.
