Build a responsive, engaging Empowerment page for VQ Basketball Foundation that highlights all empowerment initiatives, especially those beyond basketball training. The page should explain how the foundation equips young girls — especially at the grassroots level — with practical skills and opportunities that foster economic independence, career readiness, and personal growth.

🧱 Page Structure
1. Hero Section

Headline: Empowering Girls for Life — On and Off the Court

Subheadline: Equipping young girls with skills, education, confidence, and opportunities for a brighter future.

Full-width image of girls participating in an empowerment activity or training.

Primary CTA Button: Support Our Empowerment Programs

Short paragraph explaining that VQ’s empowerment initiatives go beyond basketball — they prepare girls for sustainable livelihoods, leadership, and community contribution.

Emphasize that many girls in underserved communities lack access to skills training and opportunities.

3. Core Empowerment Programs

Create visually distinct sections or cards for each major program:
